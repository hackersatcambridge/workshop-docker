# Workshop materials for Docker -- making development and deployment easy

## Introduction

Have you ever encountered problems getting somebody else's code to build / work correctly?

In this workshop we introduce Docker - a lightweight container environment - and walk you through some of the best features. Developing and deploying programs has never been simpler!

Please bring your own laptop with Docker installed.
We recommend that you use Docker in Linux (or a Linux VM).
